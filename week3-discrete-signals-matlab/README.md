Unit Impulse:Models a “sample at one time index”; system impulse response
Unit Step:Turns on a system/input at n=0  
Unit Ramp:Tests system response to linearly increasing inputs.
Right-Sided Exponential:Fundamental LTI mode; appears in natural/forced responses
Signum:Simple nonlinearity; useful in examples and symmetry checks.
Discrete Sinc:Windowed-sinc FIR design; reconstruction/intuitive link to bandwidth
