# we define 2 moving-average FIR filters  and  computes frequency responses with freqz (both linear and dB),Converts transfer functions to zeros/poles/gain with tf2zpk.
# How to run: Save the script as a valid MATLAB name, FIR_and_IIR_filters.m.
# FIR,full name is Finite Impulse Response, no recuive,stable  ; and IIR,  full name is  Infinite Impulse Response , very shape,
